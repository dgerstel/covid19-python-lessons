Data analysis exercises/examples using publicly available data about the COVID-19 infections for teaching basics of Python.

# Prerequisites: remember to 
- git clone the COVID-19 data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 to the main directory of this repository
- update the results daily from within the `COVID-19` directory (`git pull`) resulting from the previous step

# Status and ideas:
- an1-2 ready
- an3 to be fixed

- maybe start with cleaning data globally
- maybe use subsamples
- not sure if dictionaries help or hinder in pedagogy (possible two solutions)
